News 1 Title: "Latest Patch Notes (2.7)" 
News 1 Message: "Miniature Charms have been added! There are now 94 little buddies you can collect! Miniature Charms can drop from any monster; the drop rates are 1 in 6000 (Normal), 1 in 4000 (Nightmare) and 1 in 2000 (Hell). Gift Boxes have retired from Gheeds shop and can no longer randomly drop. Cubing a gift box is no longer recommended. Act 1 Hirelings no longer approach enemies to attack them in melee range. Hirelings were reverted to 2.4 vanilla stats in order to fix act 2 mercs not activating their aura."

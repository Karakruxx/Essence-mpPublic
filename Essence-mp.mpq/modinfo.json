News 1 Title: "Latest Patch Notes (2.6)" 
News 1 Message: "Gift boxes have fully incubated and can now be cubed alone to acquire their contents! Hirelings were reverted to 2.4 vanilla stats in order to fix act 2 mercs not activating their aura. Gheed is now selling 'Gift Box' in his miscellaneous tab. They can also be found anywhere a rune can drop, at about the rate of a Lo rune. Cubing them with a key will create a storage item. Candy no longer drops from anything besides Halloween Ghosts. Added new inventory images for elite unique jewels. Fixed a few abyssal set items displaying their normal inventory image. Added a storage item for Full Rejuvenation Potions, 'Time-locked Elixir'."

Mod Version: 2.8
News 1 Title: "Latest Patch Notes (2.8)" 
News 1 Message: "Annihilus Runeword Infusions have been added! Cubing Annihilus with the runes to make a Vanilla Runeword will add auras and one other powerful property to the charm; this includes all 23 Vanilla Runewords that give an aura when equipped. (NOTICE - these cube recipes only work on newly generated Annihilus charms!!!) Miniature Charms have been added! There are now 94 little buddies you can collect! Miniature Charms can drop from any monster; the drop rates are 1 in 6000 (Normal), 1 in 4000 (Nightmare) and 1 in 2000 (Hell). Gift Boxes have retired from Gheeds shop and can no longer randomly drop. Cubing a gift box is no longer recommended. Act 1 Hirelings no longer approach enemies to attack them in melee range. Hirelings were reverted to 2.4 vanilla stats in order to fix act 2 mercs not activating their aura."

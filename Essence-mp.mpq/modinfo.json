News 1 Title: "Latest Patch Notes (2.5)" 
News 1 Message: "Gheed is now selling "Gift Box" in his miscellaneous tab. They can also be found anywhere a rune can drop, at about the rate of a Lo rune. Cubing them with a key will create a storage item. Candy no longer drops from anything besides Halloween Ghosts. Added new inventory images for elite unique jewels. Fixed a few abyssal set items displaying their normal inventory image. Added a storage item for Full Rejuvenation Potions, 'Time-locked Elixir'. Candy can no longer be purchased from vendors. Halloween Ghosts have retired. You might be able to still find them lingering in a place that does not exist though..."
